# K-means-Clustering
Clustering is similar to classification , but the basis is different. In clustering you dont know what you are looking for and you are trying to identify 
some segments or clusters in your data.
When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures , clusters and grouping you would have never 
thought of otherwise
